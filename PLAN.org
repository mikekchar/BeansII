*** DONE SPIKE: Investigate possibility of using ES6 features
    CLOSED: [2015-08-09 Sun 15:35]
    Coffeescript already gives me quite a bit of the stuff I want.
    The only thing really missing is Promises and that is supported
    by all current browsers.
*** DONE SPIKE: Can we use node to test?
     CLOSED: [2015-08-09 Sun 15:38]
     No. V8 in current Node is almost exactly 1 year old.  I think this is a bad
     idea, unfortunately (as much as I would like to have a complete console
     based setup).
*** TODO Deploy Beans II [4/6]
    Beans II will be written in Coffeescript, with no 3rd party dependencies
    Even though there is no code yet, deployment is the most important story,
    so I need to work it out.
**** DONE SPIKE: How do we compile assets?
     CLOSED: [2015-08-09 Sun 15:58]
     Looks like Webpack is the way to go.
**** DONE Set up npm
      CLOSED: [2015-08-09 Sun 17:08]
**** DONE Create a link from the README that will run the app.
     CLOSED: [2015-08-09 Sun 21:37]
     Looks like the only way to do this is with the gh-pages branch
**** DONE Update README to explain how to deploy
     CLOSED: [2015-08-09 Sun 21:40]
*** DONE Put link to source code on site to comply with AGPL
    CLOSED: [2015-08-09 Sun 21:53]
*** TODO Compile assets
**** TODO Create a webpack loader that does mostly nothing
     see https://webpack.github.io/docs/tutorials/getting-started/ 
**** TODO Create a webpack loader that runs a stupid test with jasmine
